## Bubbles

I made this as an exercise for my other project [Runner-game](https://github.com/Marit207/Runner-game). 
I wanted to learn how Sprites work, so I made an exercise where I created a lot of Sprites.
It was a lot of fun. It was also interesting to see that with Sprites, it's super easy to change from 10 balls to a million balls, without extra code!
